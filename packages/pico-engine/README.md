[![Node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/pico-engine.svg)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

An implementation of the [pico-engine](http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/03/rebuilding_krl.shtml) hosted on node.js

## Getting Started

### Installing

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS or Current (we recommend LTS).

- Windows - use the installer at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Mac - use the installer at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use [n bash script](https://github.com/tj/n) (n makes it easy to switch between node versions)
- Linux - we recommend the [n bash script](https://github.com/tj/n) which will allow you to easily install and switch between node versions.

Once you have node installed, use npm to install the `pico-engine`;

```sh
$ npm install -g pico-engine
```

Now your system has a new command called `pico-engine`.

To start the engine simply run this command

```sh
$ pico-engine
http://localhost:8080
```

Copy the url into a browser and see the UI.

#### Troubleshooting

###### If install fails and you see `gyp ERR! ...` in the output:

pico-engine uses [leveldb](http://leveldb.org) to store data. It's a C++ library which is prebuilt for most systems. However, if the prebuilt binary is not available for your combination of operating system and node.js version, npm will compile it for you using [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation). However, `node-gyp` assumes your system will have python 2 and a c++ compiler available.

**Windows**

Open command prompt as Administrator then run `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` That will configure python and c++ compiler for npm.

**Mac / Linux**

Be sure you have python 2.7 installed. If python 3 is the system default, all you need to do is configure npm to use python 2.7 like so `npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7`

To setup C++

```sh
# Mac
xcode-select --install
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential
# AWS Linux
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

For more help, see [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).

###### If these steps don't help

Open an [issue](https://github.com/picolab/pico-engine/issues/new) and tag @farskipper. Please include your operating system, node.js version (`node -v`), and a copy of the error output.

### Bootstrap

The first time you run the system it will create a root Pico and install two rulesets.

There are two rulesets used by all Picos:

- `io.picolabs.wrangler` is used by each Pico to keep track of itself and its children
- `io.picolabs.visual_params` is used by each Pico to keep track of it in the My Picos page

### Using the My Picos page

With the rulesets installed, you can drag the rounded rectangle of your Pico and drop it
wherever you want it. In its "About" tab (click on it to reveal the tabs) you can change its
display name and color.

Also in the "About" tab, you can add and delete child Picos.

In the "Rulesets" tab you can see the information held for your Pico by each of its rulesets.
By clicking on a ruleset id,
you will be taken to the Engine Rulesets page
where you can see its source code.

To make your own ruleset, write your code in the box in the
Engine Rulesets page.
Use the "validate" button until the code compiles.
Then use the "register" button to register this version
of your code with the engine.

### Updating/downgrading

Heads up! Especially when downgrading there may be a risk of data loss. It's recommended you backup your pico-engine home folder first. By default the folder is located `~/.pico-engine/` it contains your database.

```sh
# to view your current version
$ pico-engine --version

# to view what npm has installed globally
$ npm ls -g --depth 0 pico-engine

# to view available versions
$ npm view pico-engine versions

# to install a specific version i.e. `0.41.0`
$ npm install -g pico-engine@0.41.0
```

## CLI

### Configuration

The server is configured via some environment variables.

- `PORT` - The port the http server should listen on. By default it's `8080`
- `PICO_ENGINE_HOME` - Where the database and other files should be stored. By default it's `~/.pico-engine/`
- `PICO_ENGINE_HOST` - The public url prefix to reach this engine. This is the `meta:host` value in KRL. By default it's `"http://localhost:8080"`

The `PORT` is the only valued used in setting up the engineâ€™s [nodejs http server](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_port_host_backlog_callback). We only specify the `port` so it listens listens to all traffic on that port, it will not filter by host.

`PICO_ENGINE_HOST` is simply used for `meta:host` which is just a string that indicates the url prefix you want others to use when talking to the engine.

For example, say you want to have your engine running with SSL on a custom domain i.e. `https://example.com` Starting the engine like this `PICO_ENGINE_HOST=https://example.com pico-engine` is not enough. You will need to use a reverse proxy server like nginx to handle the SSL termination, and then forward the traffic to your private port that is running the engine.
